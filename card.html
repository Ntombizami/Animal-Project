			<p>Penguins are designed to easily adapt to water and very cold conditions.
			 They can stay under water for 10-15mins before coming to surface to breathe.
		     Penguins are highly social (very fond of humans too) and usually loud at their parties.
			 They are flightless birds and predominantly feed on aquatic animals.
